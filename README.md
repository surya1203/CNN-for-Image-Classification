# CNN-for-Image-Classification
Situation: 
Image classification is one of the most important part of digital image analysis available to us today. Image classification applications are used in many areas, such as medical imaging, object identification in satellite images, traffic control systems, brake light detection, machine vision, and more. 

Task: 
I aimed to classify CIFAR-10 images with an accuracy of around 60 to 65% accuracy. 

Action: 
Built multiple CNN models with some differences in their architecture by using drop-out layers. 


Reward: Not only was I able to achieve the desired results of 65% accuracy, but also find out placement of drop-out layers can affect the results significantly, and may even make it worse in some cases.
